# Optimization of Neural Network Models for Classification Tasks

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the implementation of machine learning models with regularization, optimization, and error analysis techniques to improve model performance, convergence speed, and efficiency. Specifically, we focus on comparing a simple neural network model without any optimization techniques to a model that incorporates several optimization methods.

## Dataset

## Models

### 1. Simple Neural Network Model (Baseline)

A simple neural network model was implemented without any optimization techniques. The model consists of:

- Two hidden layers with 64 neurons each and ReLU activation functions.
- An output layer with softmax activation for classification.

### 2. Optimized Neural Network Model

The optimized neural network model includes the following optimization techniques:

- **Batch Normalization**: Applied after the first hidden layer to normalize the activations.
- **Dropout**: Applied after the second hidden layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Used with a learning rate of 0.001 for efficient training.

## Results and Discussion

### Performance Metrics

The performance of both models was evaluated using accuracy on the validation and test datasets. Here are the key findings:

- **Baseline Model**:

  - Validation Accuracy: [value]
  - Test Accuracy: [value]

- **Optimized Model**:
  - Validation Accuracy: [value]
  - Test Accuracy: [value]

### Error Analysis

The optimized model showed significant improvements in both convergence speed and overall accuracy compared to the baseline model. The use of batch normalization and dropout effectively reduced overfitting and improved generalization on the test dataset.
